# `DOM Commander`

A makeshift vanilla-js DOM-manipulation library with jQuery-like syntax.


## Features

- Selection and manipulation of multiple elements
- Chainable methods for easier DOM manipulation
- Similar API to standard DOM methods

> [!NOTE]
> This is something I made for fun. Do not take this too seriously.

## Usage

```js
import { $ } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Shresht7/DOM-Commander/dist/index.js'

$('.red').classList.add('hide') // Adds the class 'hide' to all elements with the class 'red'
```
